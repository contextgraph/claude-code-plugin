# ContextGraph Plugin for Claude Code

AI-forward persistent task management and planning that integrates directly into Claude Code.

## What is ContextGraph?

ContextGraph is a **living planning layer** that self-improves with every agentic execution. It provides:

1. **Low-friction planning input**: Vibe-like, natural language planning that integrates everywhere you work
2. **Living, responsive planning layer**: Plans that improve and evolve with every agentic execution, learning optimal action sizing and context relevance
3. **Self-documenting outputs**: Automatically generates tailored documentation for different purposes and personas

The system transforms free-form ideas into optimally-sized, executable actions with just-right contextâ€”eliminating wasted tokens and retry loops while capturing the full story of how work evolves.
