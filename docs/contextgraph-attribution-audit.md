# ContextGraph Attribution Audit

**Date:** February 16, 2026
**Action ID:** 886215ca-c86c-42be-a7a1-7632da681ea0
**Status:** ✅ Verified - No changes required

## Objective

Audit all plugin documentation (README.md, SETUP.md, and plugin.json) to ensure capabilities are properly attributed to ContextGraph as the workflow system rather than to specific AI models, ensuring consistent messaging across all touchpoints.

## Files Audited

1. `claude-code-plugin/README.md` (137 lines)
2. `claude-code-plugin/plugins/contextgraph/SETUP.md` (43 lines)
3. `claude-code-plugin/plugins/contextgraph/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (19 lines)

## Findings

### ✅ All Documentation Correctly Attributes to ContextGraph

All three files properly attribute capabilities to **ContextGraph** rather than specific AI models:

#### plugin.json
- **Name:** "contextgraph"
- **Description:** "A living planning layer that gets smarter with every execution"
- **Result:** No model attribution present ✅

#### README.md
- Opens with: "Your context graph is a **living planning layer** that self-improves with every agentic execution"
- Features described as ContextGraph capabilities (e.g., "Persistent Action Management", "Hierarchical Planning")
- **Result:** Features described as ContextGraph capabilities, not model capabilities ✅

#### SETUP.md
- Uses terminology like "ContextGraph plugin", "ContextGraph MCP server"
- Instructions describe configuring the ContextGraph system
- **Result:** No model-specific attribution ✅

## Appropriate vs. Inappropriate References

The audit confirmed the distinction between appropriate integration references and inappropriate attribution:

### ✅ Appropriate (found in documentation)
- "Claude Code can use these tools" - describes the host environment
- "ContextGraph plugin for Claude Code" - product integration
- "Once installed, Claude Code will use the ContextGraph MCP server" - integration setup

### ❌ Inappropriate (NOT found in documentation)
- "Powered by Claude"
- "Generated by Anthropic"
- "Uses Claude AI"
- Model-specific capability claims

## Conclusion

**No changes required.** All plugin documentation already follows the correct attribution pattern, consistently crediting ContextGraph as the workflow system while appropriately referencing Claude Code only as the integration environment.

This audit confirms that the plugin's external messaging aligns with the parent action's goal of ensuring ContextGraph (not specific models) receives attribution for generated content and capabilities.

## Related Work

This audit is part of the broader effort documented in parent action [a28d8a89-77eb-4de4-b935-66358f6503c2](https://contextgraph.dev/actions/a28d8a89-77eb-4de4-b935-66358f6503c2) to remove model attribution from all prompts and ensure consistent ContextGraph attribution across the entire codebase.
